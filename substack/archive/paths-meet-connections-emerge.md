**Hello friends,**

First, a big thank you for sticking around and supporting my creative journey—it means so much. I'm excited to share that I'll be making this newsletter more regular, so you can expect consistent updates on my projects and adventures.

It's been eight months since my last release, *STARMAP* on the Foundation platform, but I've been far from idle. I've been working on multiple projects to build a robust portfolio for galleries, shows, and potential clients. It's been a labor of love, and I'm eager to share more with you soon.

### A Creative Adventure in France

Recently, I had the honor of participating in the **Biennale des Imaginaires Numériques, par Chroniques** in the south of France as part of the Quebec delegation. The trip, organized by OFQJ/LOJIQ, connected artists, collectors, and digital art professionals over seven unforgettable days. The event brought together multiple french speaking communities from all around the world in the form of delegations. Nations that were represented are: Québec, France, Belgique & Liban. We all got along so well too. Core memories! 

We explored cities like Marseille, Arles, Avignon, and Aix-en-Provence, visiting art installations, exhibitions, and interactive public spaces.Full of snacks and pastis, we also attended artist pitches, networking events, and discussions that deepened my understanding of the digital art world. It was an incredible experience, sparking new ideas and collaborations.

I really want to thank OFQJ, LOJIQ & HACNUM for this beautiful opportunity. Superb program and they really nailed it on organizing the whole thing. Bravo!

### A Special Collaboration with Romain Astouric

During the trip, I reconnected with **Romain Astouric (DataFlaw)**, a talented artist from the French delegation. We later met in Quebec to record an episode for his podcast and newsletter, **Futur Intérieur**.

Recording with Romain was such a fun and inspiring experience! We talked about how I started creating generative art in 2017, my creative routines, and, of course, we geeked out over everything you can make with computer code. I won't spoil the episode, but if you listen and enjoy it, I highly recommend subscribing to Romain's Substack for more fascinating content. (Just a heads-up: the episode is in French!)

### Expanding Locally and Online

While Web3 and digital tokens remain exciting areas I'm committed to exploring, I'm also working on diversifying how I share my art to reach a broader audience.

Here's what's in the works:

- **An Updated Website**: I'm adding an online shop and a dedicated project page to make my work more accessible.

- **Commission Work**: I'm open to custom projects!

**Stay tuned for more updates on these developments.**
