Welcome to Substack! Today's post will be more of an update of sorts. This week has been quite eventful, so let me give you a quick summary.

## THE ONLY WAY TO STOP TIME

This week new release! This artwork explores the concept of time through autonomous agents, Perlin noise, and rotation mathematics. The artwork is created using JavaScript and p5.js, and features a real-time parameter modifier created using the dat.gui library.

It is available on Versum : [https://versum.xyz/token/versum/32631](https://versum.xyz/token/versum/32631)

## THE QUICK SUMMARY THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT RIGHT BEFORE

On Monday, I decided to create an account on Substack to start this blog. It's a great way to keep everyone up to date on what I'm working on and share my progress as an artist. I'm thrilled to say that I already have a dozen subscribers! Thank you all for joining me on this journey.

Currently, I'm working on my Genuary 32nd drop on fx(hash), and it's almost complete. I had some trouble with shape collision detection, but I plan to dive into that topic in a future post. Right now, I'm at the stage where I'm testing multiple features and considering adding some textures to the shape and overall composition.

While working on my tutorial article for next week, I stumbled upon a very interesting debug view on Thursday. I got hyper focused on exploring this path and ended up spending the whole day on it. The output was so fascinating that I wanted to share it with you all. Here's a couple of outputs when I was out pathfinding yesterday:

## WHAT'S TO COME

My top priority right now is wrapping up my Genuary 32nd project. It's been a challenging but rewarding experience, and I can't wait to share the final result with you all.

After that, I'll be continuing a new long form generative project in collaboration with another digital artist. Unfortunately, I can't give too much away just yet, but trust me when I say that I'm really excited about this one. It should be published on FX(hash). Stay tuned for more updates on that front!

I'm also working on my next landscape generator project, which I've nicknamed "Corduroy Mountains" (although that name is definitely subject to change). As a self-proclaimed landscape geek, I'm really excited about this project. I think it's going to be pretty cool, and I can't wait to share it with you all. Here is some pre-alpha outputs

Speaking of landscapes, I've been toying with the idea of doing some plein-air generative art this summer. Of course, that's all dependent on the weather. I'm not particularly keen on freezing to death from hypothermia, but I suppose we'll see how things go!

All in all, I'm excited about the projects and plans I have in store for the future. Thank you all for following along on this journey with me. Stay tuned for more updates and exciting developments!

The next post should be a small tutorial about Generator function in Javascript and why they can be useful for generative art.

Thanks to everyone who took the time to read this post. I hope it will keep you interested in this very interesting medium that is generative art.

All type of support is really important to get the word around so, don't hesitate to share this on socials or anyone who might be interested. If you want to stay updated on the content here, please subscribe! Have a great weekend everyone!
