Hello everyone, long time no see and welcome to all the new subscribers from the past 2 months. I'm really sorry that I don't post here more often. Writing is still a bit intimidating to me so I've been procrastinating a lot with my newsletter post. I most definitely plan to write more often here but maybe I'll make shorter post, If I can.

So lets get to it!

## THE BASICS

STARMAP is available on Foundation

64 unique artwork / 0.05ETH

## I JUST GOT CURATED!

You heard that right! STARMAP was curated by Forever Project (Foundation.app) to be part of their new digital exhibition called Under Neith. This is pretty exiting because it is the first time that I got curated for a group show. Foundation is such a big brand in the space and I'm so grateful for the opportunity to participate in this exhibit. What's even more awesome is that it's a group show! So I got to create alongside Night Sea, Alessandro Fiore(Whitekross) and Sterling Crispin.

Of course it was pretty intimidating to be featured alongside these insanely talented artist but at the same time it felt very genuine. I feel like all of our projects are on the same plane both in the concept and visually speaking and it says a lot of good things about the concept of the show.

## UNDER NEITH

Under Neith is the name of the exhibit put together by Forever Project. Here's an excerpt of the official exhibit statement:

This story of Neith, steeped in the mysteries of the cosmos, serves as a parallel for the loss, longing, and the ceaseless pursuit of understanding that we experience in our lives.

Just as Neith appeared to early astronomers only to vanish from both sight and record, so does our grasp on certainty and truth shift with time. This story asks us to contemplate our responses to the unanswerable questions of existence: How do we reckon with the vast unknowns of the universe? What does it mean to seek answers to questions that may be unanswerable? 

"How do we reckon with the vast unknowns of the universe? What does it mean to seek answers to questions that may be unanswerable?"

Through each of their works, **Alessandro Fiore, Jonathan Barbeau, Night Sea,** and **Sterling Crispin,** probe the depths of absence—the void left by lost love, vanished dreams, and the silent spaces that define our inner and outer worlds.

They express the unspeakable and visualize the invisible, each piece acting as a meditation on the parts of our universe and lives that remain shrouded in mystery.

## THE STARMAP

STARMAP uses a particle field system that is similar to "Jeu de Ligne" and "EX-LIBRIS". There is two key difference though: 

- The moving speed of each particle is not static and increase over time.

- The noise range of each particle is decreasing and when it hits a threshold it's increment back to positive and makes this kind of "yo-yo" in values.

This makes the particles more dynamic and creates some organic pattern that verge on the fine line between a chaotic and structured composition.

Conceptually, I've been wanting to work on a space themed collection for a good while, so when Foundation approached me for Under Neith I knew this project was perfect for it. 

With STARMAP, I wanted to show off the beauty of space but also how intimidating it is. It's a place of infinite vastness, it contains all the matter in the universe but it's also mostly empty. Each pieces represent the point of view of a space explorer that is charting point of interest so that it can send them back home for analysis. I've made it so that the beauty directly contrast with the sense of being lost and the feeling of being homesick.

As much as I'm passionate about space and the cosmos, it creeps me the f*ck out. My worst nightmare is to be lost in space without being able to find my way back home and what's more, time is relative so I could come back but at a different era...lost in time. I remember all the kids that wanted to be an astronaut when they would be grown up and I knew that was a N.O.P.E for me. This is also something I wanted to highlight in this project: You can be in awe in front of something truely beautiful but that longing for home is always present.

## WRAPPING UP

It's more than time to wrap up this article. It was a dificult write-up. I don't know why but I kept on procrasting finishing it. I think it's been a draft for the last 3 weeks at last so I'm very happy to final check that box haha.

I'm so grateful for this opportunity to be a part of Forver Project roster in a curated group show. The concept was such a cool idea and instantly stroke a cord with my love for the cosmos and my curiosity for deeper meaning.

It's also such a pleasure to be featured alongside these amazing artist. Shout out to Sterling Crisping, David and Johan from NighSea and Alessandro Fiore (Whitekross). You're all amazing artist. I'm really grateful to have been able to meet some of you in Marfa back in September! Let's keep in touch :) 

I hope you found this article interesting and I promise to try and release more articles in the coming days. Maybe shorter one though so I find them less intimidating.

If you would like some specific content from me, please let me know in the comments :)

SPACE OFF!
