## Jonathan Barbeau - Creative Process

Nourished by a deep passion for the natural world and its phenomena, I use JavaScript as a programming language to express my creativity and explore natural mechanisms. My web development training began during an exploration course at Cégep de Sainte-Foy eight years ago, and since then, my artistic approach has continued to evolve.

### Cladogram Research

My central technique draws directly from cladograms used in evolutionary biology. Just as these trees map evolutionary relationships between different species, this method allows me to navigate through my concepts in an intuitive and experimental way.

Git becomes my creative mapping tool, similar to taxonomic classification methods. At each interesting stage of my creation, I can create a commit, a kind of branching point that allows me to trace the evolution of my artistic process, just as a geneticist traces the evolution of species.

Diagnosed with ADHD, I developed this method as a strategy for managing ideas. My diverse interests that characterize my neurological profile become opportunities for creation, like genetic mutations that can lead to new forms of life. My ability to rapidly explore different conceptual branches becomes a unique creative force.

### The Computer as Co-Creator

One might think that the computer handles logic and order while I handle chaos, but it's quite the opposite. I design instructions that allow the computer to interpret my ideas. In this relationship with the machine, I take care of the artistic direction and the machine completes the details and executes the work through parameters defined by the algorithm. This approach recalls natural selection processes through a structured creative environment that allows for emergence.

Since last year, I have been immersing myself in the study of particle systems and their movements. Models like Brownian motion, Perlin noise, attractors, chaos theory, and the emergence of forms fascinate me. These natural phenomena, algorithmically reproducible, create a fascinating bridge between art and science, between observation and creation.

My great curiosity and multiple questions about what surrounds me have shaped an artistic approach in constant evolution. The art-technology symbiosis constitutes the heart of my approach. In this collaboration, I define the creative orientation, while the machine develops the nuances through precise algorithmic parameters. This method evokes evolutionary emergence principles within a structured creative ecosystem.

My recent creations explore the dialectic between presence and absence, memory and forgetting, immensity and solitude. Through my research on particle systems and Perlin noise, I materialize the fragility of civilizations and the erosion of memories in "Je Me Souviens" (I Remember), while contemplating our place in the cosmos with "STARMAP". This duality between the intimate and the infinite characterizes my work – sometimes a stellar cartographer inviting contemplation of cosmic mysteries, sometimes an archivist of memories capturing the disintegration of our greatest creations.
