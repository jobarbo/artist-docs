## Jonathan Barbeau - Group Introduction

Hi everyone! I'm Jonathan, a generative artist from Quebec City. I use JavaScript & p5.js to explore natural phenomena through code. My creative process mirrors evolutionary biologyâ€”I use Git like DNA mapping to branch through different artistic territories. Currently fascinated by the line between abstract & figurative, working with particle systems and those repeating-yet-random patterns we see everywhere in nature. Recent pieces: "Je Me Souviens", "STARMAP", "Jeu de Ligne". Excited to connect with this community!
