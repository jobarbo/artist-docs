## Jonathan Barbeau - Creative Process

I create digital art using JavaScript and p5.js to explore natural phenomena and biological systems. My practice bridges web development expertise with a deep fascination for the patterns and mechanisms found in nature.

## 0. Core Philosophy

The main driving force of my work is curiosity through exploration. What will come out of these research will reveal themselves through the journey. Generative art in itself is a exercise in letting go of control but I also apply it in what I will explore visually.

I start with very basic ideas or system and then build whole catalogue of works with different project from the same source.

## 1. Methodology: Evolutionary Creative Process

### 1.1 Cladogram-Inspired Project System

My creative process draws from **cladograms** used in evolutionary biology. Just as these trees map species relationships, I navigate conceptual territories through branching, experimental pathways.

### 1.2 Git as Creative DNA

I use **Git version control** as my primary creative mapping tool. Each commit becomes an evolutionary branch point—allowing me to trace artistic development like a geneticist tracking species evolution. This system lets me explore multiple conceptual directions while preserving every creative iteration.

### 1.3 Embracing Creative Divergence

My naturally scattered curiosity becomes a strategic advantage. Diverse interests function like beneficial mutations, leading to unexpected creative forms. The ability to rapidly shift between conceptual territories generates unique connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.

## 2. Technical Implementation

### 2.1 p5.js: My Digital Canvas

As you know since I'm posting here, I work primarily with **p5.js**, a JavaScript library designed for creative coding. This framework helps me explore and translate natural phenomena into visual expressions through algorithmic interpretation.

### 2.2 Code as Artistic Language

Right now my work is exploring these subject:

- Movement patterns and particle behaviors
- Environmental systems and organic processes
- Complex phenomena like Brownian motion and Perlin noise fields

## 3. Current Exploration: The Edge of Recognition

My recent focus centers on movement patterns and structural composition, specifically the fascinating territory where order meets randomness. I'm increasingly drawn to **repeating yet random compositions** found everywhere in nature and urban environments.

### 3.1 Visual Inspiration Sources

- Light filtering through window blinds - creating rhythmic yet unpredictable patterns
- Pareidolia in marble flooring - where random stone formations suggest familiar shapes
- Fractal structures in vegetables - organic geometries that repeat at different scales

These phenomena share a common thread: they exist on the **fine line between abstract and figurative**. This tension between recognition and mystery has become central to my artistic investigation.

### 3.2 Recent Works

- **"Je Me Souviens"** - examining memory through fragmented, semi-recognizable forms
- **"STARMAP"** - cosmic patterns that hover between data visualization and constellation mythology
- **"Jeu de Ligne"** - linear compositions that suggest both architectural structure and organic growth

### 3.3 Upcoming Series

I'm developing a new body of work that builds directly on "Jeu de Ligne" and synthesizes everything I've learned over the past two years. This series will push further into the ambiguous space where viewers oscillate between seeing pure abstraction and recognizing familiar forms—that moment of perceptual uncertainty that makes us question what we're actually seeing.
