Over the past few years, my artistic exploration has centered on the intersection of natural phenomena, algorithmic processes, and the question of memory (both cosmic and personal).

During that time, working primarily with JavaScript as my creative language and GIT as a versioning tool, I've been developing what I call a "cladogram methodology," inspired by evolutionary biology, where Git becomes a tool for mapping my ideas and creative evolution. This approach transforms my branching thinking patterns into a repository of my life's work. It evolves as I work on my craft and it's a really satisfying process.

In the last couple of years I've been focused intensively on particle systems, Perlin noise, Brownian motion, and chaos theory. These technical interests serve deeper conceptual investigations, helping me study the duality of presence and absence, memory and oblivion, the personal and the infinite.

This research has manifested in projects like "Je Me Souviens," where I spent over a year developing textured systems that visualize civilizational fragility and the erosion of memory. The work uses glitch-like aesthetics and layered compositions to capture how time transforms our greatest achievements into empty shells. In parallel, "STARMAP" and "Et si l'univers nous regardait?" explore our place in the cosmos (as tiny as it can be) and position the viewer alternately as stellar cartographer and the loneliest being in the universe—engaging with both cosmic mysteries and the realization of how solitary memories lose meaning without witnesses.

I have also been working on generating satisfying composition, which is not a small feat when working with code based art. For example, I didn't use any color for a year for the sole purpose of improving the relationship of the shapes and subject within my work to render more impactful structures within the picture plane. Then I've started adding back color and layering my work with past techniques to create interesting patterns that are both busy and minimalistic, creating a visual rhythm that is interesting to look at.

More recently, I've been transitioning from static prints toward interactive performance. I'm exploring how my algorithmic work can respond to real-time data like music, sound, movement, and tactile interaction. To achieve this, I use external hardware like MIDI controllers and shader programming to create responsive, living systems that blur the line between composition and improvisation.

My goal in 2026 is to give my first live performance collaborating with musical artists, where the visual and sonic elements will co-evolve in real time. I'm developing installations where participants become co-creators, their interactions shaping the final form, which then remains as a unique testament to that collective creative moment and further my study of collective presence and memories.

Throughout this journey, my relationship with the computer remains central—not as a tool that handles logic while I handle chaos, but the contrary. I focus on instructions that allow emergence and let the machine interpret my artistic direction in a way that leaves room for the unexpected, echoing natural processes within a structured creative ecosystem.
