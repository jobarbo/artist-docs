Over the last 24 months, I've developed what I call a "cladogram methodology"—a Git-based workflow inspired by evolutionary biology's tree of life. Instead of scattering projects across multiple folders and hard drives, I've centralized my entire artistic practice into a single Git monorepo where each project, idea, and exploration exists as a branch within one repository.

This approach transforms version control into a creative mapping tool. Every commit becomes a milestone, every branch represents an evolutionary path of ideas, and the resulting structure visually resembles a cladogram (those branching diagrams biologists use to show evolutionary relationships between species). That way, I can trace how one project spawned another, see which ideas are "children" of earlier explorations, and navigate my entire creative history from a single location.

What makes this distinctive is that while Git is standard in software development, using it this as a modular, centralized creative archive where the branching structure itself becomes a visual statement is not common practice it seems, even among generative artists. The workflow fits naturally with how my mind works: exploring multiple directions simultaneously while maintaining clear connections between ideas. As someone fascinated by natural systems and evolution, having my creative process literally mirror the tree of life feels both conceptually satisfying and practically powerful.

After discussing this approach with other artists and realizing its uniqueness, I began documenting it. I was recently featured in a local magazine where I discussed generative art and this cladogram-based Git workflow, hoping to share how version control can become an artistic tool in itself, not just a technical necessity.
