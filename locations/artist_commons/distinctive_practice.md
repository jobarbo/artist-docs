What feels most distinctive about my practice is its versatility across contexts and collaborations. While I'm rooted in algorithmic art using JavaScript, my work adapts to vastly different scales and mediums, from prints to large-scale public installations, from static compositions to live performance.

I've created responsive art installations for commercial spaces like Sartoro Geneve in Dubai, where the work needed to function as both art and spatial experience. I've collaborated with dancers in Germany for the Interfaces collection at the Opéra National de Hanovre, using motion capture to translate choreography into generative compositions.

I'm currently in an artist residency in Quebec City with a close friend and writer, exploring anémoïa—nostalgia for a time or place you've never known. Together, we're conducting nocturnal urban explorations through different neighborhoods, combining poetry, photography, and generative art to capture this strange feeling of longing for streets and eras that were never ours. Our shared background in multimedia integration allows us to create a hybrid digital cartography where text, image, and algorithm converge.

Finally, I'm developing a live performance system that connects MIDI controllers to shader filters, allowing me to reinterpret my generative work in real-time while responding to the sound of musical artists and the audience presence and rythm.

This ability to move fluidly between solitary studio practice and collaborative creation, between permanent installations and ephemeral performance, feels like what sets my practice apart.

The algorithmic foundation remains, but the work transforms to meet each context and more importantly, to meet each collaborator halfway. What excites me most is how collaboration introduces chaos from other people's lives, perspectives, and disciplines into my structured systems, while my own creative chaos nourishes their practice in return. A dancer's movement, a writer's words, a musician's rhythm—these external forces push my work into territories I couldn't reach alone, just as my generative systems offer them new ways to see their own work. It's this reciprocal exchange, where both practices are transformed, that builds something far more compelling than what any single vision could achieve. The result belongs to neither of us individually, but to the space we create together.
