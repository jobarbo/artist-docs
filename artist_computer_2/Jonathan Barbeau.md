# Artist & Computer 2

## Introduction

I never expected to be here, trying to write about my art. I’ve always felt like an outsider—never quite fitting in with the traditional paths. I’ve spent 7 years creating digital art and I still feel like a beginner, like I’m just scratching the surface, discovering new things about the medium and myself. There’s always more to learn, more ideas to try, and more stuff you don’t know.

Writing doesn’t come naturally to me. But storytelling matters—it’s how we bridge the gap between what we make and how others see it. Even if people close to me don’t fully understand what generative art is, they’re curious about it, and that means everything. I just want to show everyone that coding and algorithms can create something beautiful.

Math wasn’t my thing growing up. Formulas bored me, and high school exams filled me with anxiety. I didn’t know that math could be playful—that it could enable a world of creativity through programming. My early attempts at coding weren’t much better. I flunked JavaScript more than once and kept struggling with the basics. All I wanted was to create—something visual, something meaningful.

Art classes weren’t the answer either. The rules, the expectations, the rigidity—they clashed with how my mind works. Skateboarding made sense for a while: there were no rules, no pressure, just me and the board, trying again and again until I found my rhythm. Art, it turned out, could be like that too.

Now, years later, I’ve found my way of creating—a mix of everything I used to struggle with. Coding, design, problem-solving—it all comes together in my work, and it feels right. Maybe I am an artist after all.

## The Computer

Creating art with a computer feels weirdly natural to me. As I mentioned, I don’t like rules, but with code, I can build a set of instructions. It’s like writing a recipe and giving it to others—the recipe is the same, but the result varies. That’s what makes generative art so enticing: the surprise of the outcome. I am both the artist and the viewer. Collaborating with the computer gives me the ability to work on the macro while the processor handles all the details. This works really well with how I like to navigate the world.I have bouts of very intense and specific interest that I love to dig into. When learning new subject (for example, image composition) I will naturally be asking myself “what if’s?”, and start making experiments as I learn. Generative art is just that. I would start from an initial idea and then it would diverge and branch into new ideas. It is a fertile ground for trial and error and it’s easy for me to find out what I like and what needs to be discarded. That is the thrill of experimentation and discovery thrives on iteration. The trials and errors, tweaking parameters, and seeing immediate visual feedback feel almost meditative. The branching of ideas mimics the natural movement of my thoughts—exploring, diverging, converging—all while allowing the freedom to navigate those shifts instinctively. My process isn’t about perfecting a set vision; it’s about embracing fluid exploration, using the computer to channel my scattered bursts of creativity into something coherent that can evolve over time. Since this way of working can be unorganized, I needed a system to keep track of ideas and easily revisit older versions. Git, the open source repository system, became my creative anchor, allowing me to document each experiment as a branch and every iteration as a commit. It’s like a digital mind map that captures each leap or tangent without losing my starting point. Git offers both the structure and the freedom to explore while preserving every idea or point of interest along the way.

## The Artist

I do what I do because I’m an insanely curious person. I jumped between interest and hobbies all throughout my life and I always wondered how I could ever settle on a specialization. I have always been passionate about the natural world, the process of evolution, insects, animals, dinosaurs. I have all the documentaries on natural history by David Attenborough at home. Then when I was in college, I became interested in front-end development, video editing, UI-designing, and 3D modeling. How can I make a choice and go through with that choice? It’s impossible. I felt the pressure of the choices I’ll need to make. Computer art changed all that. As I got accustomed to visual programming and leveled up my skills, it hit me: with code, I can visually express my ideas, my states of mind, while also exploring the things that fascinate me. I could bring all of my scattered interests together. I could create visual systems, mimic natural processes, and visually explore concepts that had captivated me through the years.It’s the perfect merging of my curiosity for nature, my urge to create and my love for technology.

I no longer felt the need to “pick a lane.” It wasn’t about specialization anymore — it became a matter of intersection. It’s the convergence of disciplines, a sandbox where I can experiment, fail, and try again.

What makes this medium truly special to me is that it’s not just about expressing my own thoughts and emotions—it’s also about discovering something unexpected. Seeing new outputs being generated often evokes feelings I wasn’t anticipating, and sparks new ideas. It’s like the art talks back to me. There’s a feedback loop where every output becomes a prompt for further exploration, a starting point for a new question. Sometimes I’ll see something emerge on the screen that resonates deeply—something that feels more meaningful than what I initially set out to create.

These moments of surprise drive me to keep exploring. The fact that an abstract algorithm can evoke such raw, human emotion is what makes generative art so profound to me. It allows me to express and discover simultaneously, turning my computer into a space where creativity, curiosity, and emotion come together.

## The Community

For years, I thought art had to follow strict rules, and being good meant fitting into a narrow definition. Art seemed like a world that was out of reach—too structured, too incomprehensible. Everything changed when I found creative coding and generative art. It felt like discovering a hidden world, a subculture of people who, like me, loved exploring, tinkering, and creating for the sake of curiosity and expression. Suddenly, art wasn’t about staying inside the lines; it was about breaking boundaries, about letting go of usefulness and embracing the beauty of the unexpected.

This community welcomed me without hesitation. They shared knowledge, and helped me find my place. That art is not just about utility or perfection; it’s about the process, the exploration, and the joy of creating something that speaks to you. Meeting many of you in Marfa in 2023 reminded me of why I started this journey. It felt like coming home to old friends.

I feel at home with you all. I love our talks, seeing your WIPs in the morning, and sharing our struggles. Being an artist can be lonely, and this community is an unexpected gift that I’ll never take for granted.

Thank you.
